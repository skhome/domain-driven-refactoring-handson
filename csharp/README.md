# Dependencies

* dotnet 2
* NUnit 3

## Help, I don't have dotnet installed :-(

This project is a dotnet 2.1 solution, but if you don't have dotnet 2 installed, don't dispair.
There is no real dependency on dotnet. The only dependency there is is NUnit 3.

*So you can do this to get the solution working:*
Create a new command line app.
Copy the Web.API/Controllers folder over and copy the Web.API.Tests and add NUnit 3 as a dependency.
